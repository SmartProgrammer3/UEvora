# Variables representing the number of candies collected by alice, bob, and carol
alice_candies = 121
bob_candies = 77
carol_candies = 109

# Your code goes here! Replace the right-hand side of this assignment with an expression
# involving alice_candies, bob_candies, and carol_candies
total = alice_candies + bob_candies + carol_candies #soma todos
to_smash = total % 3 #Resto do total por 3 amigos
print(to_smash)
